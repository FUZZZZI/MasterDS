num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = 0

Q5. Why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example
Ans.
In Python, the while loop is a control flow statement that allows a block of 
code to be repeated until a certain condition is met. The while loop is useful 
in situations where we want to execute a piece of code multiple times until a 
specific condition is satisfied. 

Ex:-
# Simple while loop example
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

Q6. Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern.
Ans.
i = 0
while i < 6 :
    j = 0
    while j < i:
        print(i, end=' ')
        j += 1
    i += 1
    print('')
    
n=7
for i in range(0,n):
    for j in range(0,n-i-1):
        print("",end=" ")
    for j in range(0, i+1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print("\r") 
    
n=7
for i in range(0,n):
    for j in range(0,i+1):
        print("*", end="")
    print("\r")
    
Q7. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.
Ans.
i = 10
while i >= 0:
    print(i, end=' ')
    i -= 1

Q8. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1
Ans.
i = 10
while i >= 0:
    print(i, end=' ')
    i -= 1
