    "Boosting is a popular ensemble method in machine learning used to improve the performance of weak or mediocre learning algorithms. The basic idea behind boosting is to combine a set of weak learners into a strong learner by iteratively training them on the same dataset and giving more weight to the misclassified instances in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting algorithms work by sequentially adding new models to the ensemble and adjusting the weights of the training examples based on the performance of the previous models. In each iteration, a new weak learner is trained on the modified dataset (with weights assigned to each example), and the weights are updated based on the errors made by the current model. The final ensemble is obtained by combining the predictions of all the individual models in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular boosting algorithms are AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. These algorithms differ in the way they adjust the weights of the training examples and in the type of weak learner used. However, they all share the same objective of creating a strong learner from a set of weak learners.\n",
