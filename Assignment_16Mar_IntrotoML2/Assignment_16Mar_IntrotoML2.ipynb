As a result, it fits the training data too closely, to the point that it memorizes the noise or idiosyncrasies of the data instead of learning the underlying patterns. This can lead to poor performance on new data, as the model is not able to generalize well beyond the training set. The consequences of overfitting include poor accuracy, high variance, and poor generalization.\n",
