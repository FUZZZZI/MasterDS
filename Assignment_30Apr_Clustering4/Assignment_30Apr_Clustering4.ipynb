    "**Intuitive interpretation**: The Silhouette Coefficient is easy to understand and interpret. It ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better clustering performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Considers both cluster cohesion and separation**: The Silhouette Coefficient takes into account both the average distance between a data point and other points in the same cluster (cohesion) and the average distance between a data point and points in other clusters (separation). This provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of a clustering result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can handle non-spherical clusters**: Unlike some other evaluation metrics, such as the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), the Silhouette Coefficient can handle non-spherical clusters and can be used with any clustering algorithm that provides pairwise distance information.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**May not work well with noisy or overlapping data**: The Silhouette Coefficient assumes that each data point belongs to a single cluster and may not work well with noisy or overlapping data, where data points may belong to multiple clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can be biased towards equal-sized clusters**: The Silhouette Coefficient may be biased towards clustering results that produce equal-sized clusters, as the coefficient is calculated by averaging over all data points in a cluster. This may lead to overemphasizing the importance of larger clusters.\n",

    "**Does not consider cluster density**: The Silhouette Coefficient does not take into account the density of clusters, which may be an important factor in some datasets.\n",
