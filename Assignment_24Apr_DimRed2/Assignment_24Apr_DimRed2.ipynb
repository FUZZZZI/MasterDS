    "In statistics and machine learning, a projection refers to the process of transforming data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving certain characteristics of the data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that uses projections to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by identifying the directions, known as principal components, along which the data varies the most. These principal components are orthogonal to each other and are sorted in decreasing order of the amount of variation they capture in the original data. The first principal component captures the most variation, the second captures the second most variation, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the principal components are identified, PCA uses projections to map the data onto these components. The projections are the coordinates of the data points in the lower-dimensional subspace defined by the principal components. The coordinates of the data points in this subspace represent a compressed representation of the original data, where the lower-dimensional representation retains the most important information about the data.\n",

These projections allow for dimensionality reduction, as the data can be represented in a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving the most important characteristics of the data. PCA is commonly used for tasks such as data visualization, feature extraction, and noise reduction in machine learning and data analysis. "

A covariance matrix is a matrix that contains the variances and covariances of all possible pairs of variables in a dataset. For a dataset X of shape (n_samples, n_features), the covariance matrix is a square matrix of shape (n_features, n_features), denoted as C, where the (i, j)-th element of C is the covariance between the i-th and j-th features of the data.

Specifically, PCA seeks to find a set of orthogonal unit vectors (principal components) that maximize the variance of the projected data points onto these vectors. The principal components are computed by finding the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalues.\n",

The `eigenvectors` represent the **principal components**, and the `eigenvalues` represent the **variance of the data along these components**.\n",
