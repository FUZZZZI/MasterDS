    "Feature selection plays an important role in anomaly detection as it helps to identify the most relevant and informative features that are most likely to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. By selecting the most important features, the algorithm can reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the performance and efficiency of the anomaly detection process. Additionally, feature selection can help to reduce the risk of overfitting and increase the generalizability of the model. It can also simplify the interpretation of the results by focusing on the most relevant features for identifying anomalies. However, it is important to select features carefully, as selecting irrelevant or noisy features can reduce the accuracy of the model. Therefore, the selection of features should be based on a thorough understanding of the domain and the characteristics of the data."

It is computed as TP / (TP + FN), where TP is the number of true positives (anomalies correctly identified), and FN is the number of false negatives (anomalies incorrectly classified as normal).\n",
    "\n",
    "False Positive Rate (FPR): This metric measures the proportion of normal data points that are incorrectly identified as anomalies by the algorithm.

The algorithm's predictions are compared to the ground truth to compute the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. These values are then used to compute the evaluation metrics described above. It is important to note that the choice of evaluation metric(s) depends on the specific application and the desired trade-offs between different types of errors."

A point is considered a core point if it has at least a minimum number of other points within a specified radius, called the \"epsilon\" radius. Points that are within the epsilon radius of a core point are considered part of the same cluster. If a point is not within the epsilon radius of any core point, but it is still close to the cluster, it is considered a border point. Points that are not within the epsilon radius of any core point and not close to any cluster are considered noise or outliers.\n",

If there are at least a minimum number of points within the radius, a new cluster is created and all of the points within the radius are added to the cluster. The algorithm then recursively expands the cluster by finding all of the points that are within the epsilon radius of the core points, until no more points can be added to the cluster. The algorithm then selects a new unvisited point and repeats the process until all points have been visited.\n",

The epsilon parameter defines the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered part of the same cluster. The minimum number of points parameter defines the minimum number of points required to form a cluster. These hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the quality and performance of the clustering results, and they are typically chosen through trial and error or using heuristics."
