One such distance metric is the Gower distance with appropriate modifications to handle the numerical data. Alternatively, one can use a hybrid approach where numerical and categorical data are clustered separately and then combined using an appropriate merging algorithm."

Outliers are typically isolated data points that do not belong to any cluster and appear as individual leaves on the dendrogram, with no connections to other leaves. Such points will have a large vertical distance from the other leaves on the dendrogram. Alternatively, they may form a separate cluster that is distinct from the other clusters in terms of distance.\n",

Possible explanations for outliers include measurement errors, data entry errors, or genuine anomalies that require further investigation.\n",

    "It is important to note that the presence of outliers can affect the results of hierarchical clustering, and it may be necessary to remove or downweight them before clustering. This can be done by assigning a lower weight to outlier data points or by using robust clustering algorithms that are less sensitive to outliers."
