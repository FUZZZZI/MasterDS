    "b) Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. The algorithm uses statistical techniques to identify patterns in data, and then applies those patterns to new data to make predictions or decisions. An example of ML is a spam filter that learns to identify spam emails based on patterns in the content and sender.\n",
