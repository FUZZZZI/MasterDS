As the number of features (dimensions) in the dataset increases, the number of possible configurations of the data points also increases exponentially. This means that in high-dimensional spaces, the distance between any two points becomes almost the same, making it difficult to distinguish between points that are close and those that are far away.\n",

    "In KNN, the algorithm relies on finding the k nearest neighbors to a new data point based on their distances in the feature space. However, in high-dimensional spaces, the distance between the points becomes less meaningful, and the KNN algorithm may not perform well. This is because a high-dimensional space contains many \"empty\" regions, where there are no data points, and the distances between points become sparse and less informative.\n",
