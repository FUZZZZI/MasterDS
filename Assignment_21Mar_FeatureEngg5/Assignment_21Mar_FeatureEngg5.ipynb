    "The main difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding is that the former assigns a unique integer value to each category based on their order or rank, whereas the latter assigns a unique integer value to each category without any consideration of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Ordinal Encoding is preferred over Label Encoding when there is an inherent order or ranking between the categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no inherent order or ranking between the categories, such as in the case of \"eye color\" or \"favorite color\", then Label Encoding may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that for some machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, the ordering of categories can still affect performance, even if there is no inherent order or ranking, so it may still be beneficial to use Ordinal Encoding in these cases."
