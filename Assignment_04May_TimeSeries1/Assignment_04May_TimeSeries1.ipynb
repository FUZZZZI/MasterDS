    "Seasonality: A retail store's sales data shows a dip in sales during the winter months. This indicates that the store's sales are affected by the time of year.\n",
    "Cyclicity: A country's economic data shows a pattern of booms and busts that last for several years. This indicates that the country's economy is cyclical.\n",
