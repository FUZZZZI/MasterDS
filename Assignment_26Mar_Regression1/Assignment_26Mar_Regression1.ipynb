    "Here are the main assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence**: The observations are independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation does not depend on the value of any other observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of the residuals (the difference between the predicted value and the actual value of the dependent variable) is constant across all values of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality**: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No multicollinearity**: There is no high correlation between the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, there are several methods that can be used. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plotting the data**: By plotting the data, you can check whether the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Residual plots**: By plotting the residuals against the predicted values or against the independent variables, you can check for heteroscedasticity and normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Correlation matrix**: By calculating the correlation matrix between the independent variables, you can check for multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Statistical tests**: There are several statistical tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, that can be used to check the assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it is important to check the assumptions of linear regression before interpreting the results. If the assumptions are not met, it may be necessary to use a different statistical method or to transform the data to meet the assumptions."

    "Multicollinearity is a common issue that can arise in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This means that these variables contain redundant information and may not provide independent contributions to the prediction of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity can lead to unstable estimates of the regression coefficients, making it difficult to interpret the significance of individual independent variables in the model. It can also cause inflated standard errors, reducing the accuracy of the regression model.\n",

    "To detect multicollinearity, we can use various methods, such as calculating the `correlation matrix` among the independent variables, examining the `variance inflation factor` (VIF), or performing a `principal component analysis` (PCA). A high correlation coefficient or a high VIF value (>5) suggests the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address multicollinearity, we can take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove one or more of the highly correlated independent variables from the model. This reduces the redundancy and simplifies the model, but may also result in a loss of important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a technique such as PCA to transform the original set of correlated independent variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables, known as principal components. This helps to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and capture the most important information in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regularize the regression model using techniques such as Ridge regression or Lasso regression, which penalize the magnitude of the regression coefficients and encourage sparsity in the model. This helps to reduce the impact of the multicollinearity on the regression coefficients and improve the stability of the model."
