    "Anomaly detection is a machine learning technique that involves identifying unusual patterns or observations within a dataset. Its purpose is to identify instances that deviate significantly from the norm, which may be indicative of fraud, errors, defects, or other issues that require further investigation. Anomaly detection can be used in a variety of domains, including finance, cybersecurity, healthcare, and manufacturing, to detect unusual behavior that may signal a problem or threat. It can be performed using a range of techniques, including statistical methods, clustering algorithms, and deep learning models, and can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks."

    "Anomaly detection faces several challenges, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of labeled data**: Anomaly detection is typically an `unsupervised task`, which means that there is no prior knowledge of which instances are normal or anomalous. This makes it challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of the detection algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High-dimensional data**: With the increasing availability of high-dimensional data, it can be difficult to identify anomalies that may only be apparent in a few dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imbalanced data**: Anomalies are often rare events in the data, leading to class imbalance. This can make it difficult for the algorithm to detect anomalies accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept drift**: Data distributions can change over time, leading to new types of anomalies that the algorithm may not be trained to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational complexity**: Many anomaly detection algorithms involve complex computations that may be difficult to scale to large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretability**: It can be challenging to interpret the results of anomaly detection algorithms, especially for complex models such as deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",

    "In unsupervised anomaly detection, the algorithm is given a dataset without any labels indicating whether a data point is normal or anomalous. The algorithm's task is to identify patterns and structures in the data that are different from the majority of the data, and thus can be considered as anomalies. Unsupervised anomaly detection is useful **when it is difficult to obtain labeled data or when the anomaly patterns are not known in advance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in supervised anomaly detection, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset that includes both normal and anomalous data points. The algorithm learns to differentiate between normal and anomalous data based on the labeled examples. Supervised anomaly detection is useful when the types of anomalies are well-defined and labeled data is available.\n",
