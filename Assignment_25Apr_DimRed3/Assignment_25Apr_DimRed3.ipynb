If P has linearly independent columns, then it follows that A has n linearly independent eigenvectors. This is because if Av = λv, where v is an eigenvector and λ is its corresponding eigenvalue, then we can write v as a linear combination of the columns of P, say v = c1p1 + c2p2 + ... + cnpn, where pi is the ith column of P and ci are constants.

    "= λ(c1p1 + c2p2 + ... + cnpn)\n",

    "So v is also an eigenvector of A with the same eigenvalue λ, and we have shown that any eigenvector of A can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns of P. Since P has n linearly independent columns, it follows that A has n linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",

    "Condition 2: A is a symmetric matrix, or alternatively, A has n distinct eigenvalues.\n",

    "Since A = PDP^-1, we can rewrite this as AP = PD, or equivalently, AP = PD. Then, we can take the transpose of both sides to get:\n",
